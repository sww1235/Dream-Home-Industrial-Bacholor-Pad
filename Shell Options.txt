Concrete (Insulated Concrete Forms)
	-Pros
	Solid, Well insulating,potential short transport distance, fireproof, High thermal mass, high strength
	to weight ratio, thick walls, virtually ageless (if in dry climate and Non rusting rebar is used)
	-Cons
	Cement is carbon intensive, is pontentially hard to recycle, foam is made from chemicals
	and will not decompose, although if building is built to last 100 years it may not make a difference.

Papercrete

Adobe
	-Pros
	More earth friendly, litterally earth, high thermal mass, potential for zero transport carbon,
	-Cons
	Only really makes sense in certain states due to local availability of dirt and acceptance of look, not exactly fireproof, is not as insulating

Structural Insulated Panels
	-Pros
	Easy modular building, potential for lots of insulation, 
	-Cons
	transport costs/carbon, foam and other manufactured materials, thin walls, shear and compressive strength
