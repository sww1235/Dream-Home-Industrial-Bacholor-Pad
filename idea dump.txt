build thick shell out of chosen material listed in "shell options.txt" 

outer structure is 40' x 60' x 40' (H x W x D)

potential for basement if wanted, but only under part of the building

idea is to build an outer shell so as to have warehouse/soundstage space, but
then build a small dwelling unit inside.

Bring in 120/208V 3ø power at minimum, 277/480V 3ø prefered as well. 

work lights will be LED high bay lights mounted inside the roof trusses.
Each fixture will be controlled by an indivdual relay, allowing for the
individual control of fixtures

roof and walls shall be overbuilt to allow for simulateous live loads of 5 tons
on at least 4 corners of truss, as well as centers, if not on thirds or quarters.

Semi Permanent Grid of truss shall be constructed and hung from chain hoists 
attached to previously mentioned rigging points as mounting platform for AV equipment.
Control of chain hoists shall be a portable system, not one permanently installed
in the facility.

most of facility will be dedicated to an open plan for projects. However a small
house will be constructed as a living area and a place to have a library.
